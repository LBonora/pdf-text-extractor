# pdf-text-extractor-api

Extracts text from a pdf file and converts into an object

WIP

The main goal of this package is to get text information from a pdf file and make it available to be consumed by another app.

No intention of handling pages, images, or other resources from the pdf file other than extracting text with some meta data and export to another app, which will be responsible for handling and parsing.
